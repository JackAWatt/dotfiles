# dotfiles

New machine check list:
* `sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install gnome-session-fallback`
* clone this repo
* rvm
* vim with ruby support
* command-t plug in
* 
*

info: 
* check history for older versions of .vimrc
* there's another repo that has zshrc files. Will most likely add them to this repo when I get around to adding them to my development machine
